This application was a part of an online course at [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-in-2018/).

Given a URL of image, it shows faces on the image. This is done by a call to [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/). The app handles registering and signing in (passwords are saved as hashes), it keeps track of entry count for each user.
